# Wordle - Java Terminal Version

## Description
This repository contains a Java-based implementation of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, designed to run in the terminal. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word within six tries, with feedback provided through color-coded hints. This version utilizes ANSI color codes to enhance user interaction directly from the command line.

## Features
- **Terminal-Based Interface:** Enjoy the classic Wordle gameplay directly from your command line.
- **Color-Coded Feedback:** Immediate feedback on your guesses with colors indicating correct letters and placements.
- **Repeat Play:** Option to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.
